# What is Azure Event Grid?

Azure Event Grid is a service provided by Microsoft Azure that enables the creation and management of event-driven architectures. It allows developers to build reactive, event-driven applications by providing a centralized eventing backplane for publishing and subscribing to events.

The service provides a scalable and reliable platform for handling events, with the ability to process millions of events per second. It supports a wide range of event sources, including Azure services, third-party SaaS services, and custom applications. It also supports a variety of event handlers, including Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, and custom webhooks.

Azure Event Grid allows developers to easily create event-driven workflows that can respond to changes in data and state across multiple services and applications. It provides a flexible and cost-effective way to build highly responsive, distributed systems that can easily scale to meet changing demands.

Azure Logic Apps can be used for a wide range of use cases that involve automating business workflows and integrating with various services and systems. Here are some examples:

Sales order processing: A Logic App can be used to automate the sales order processing workflow. When a new sales order is created in an ERP system, the Logic App can automatically create a new record in a CRM system, send a notification to the sales team, and create a task for the shipping department to prepare the order for shipment.

Social media monitoring: A Logic App can be used to monitor social media for mentions of a company or product. When a new mention is detected, the Logic App can automatically create a support ticket in a helpdesk system, notify the customer support team, and send a reply to the customer on social media.

Data integration: A Logic App can be used to integrate data between different systems and services. For example, when a new file is uploaded to a SharePoint library, the Logic App can automatically extract data from the file and create a new record in a CRM system, update a database, or send an email notification.

E-commerce order fulfillment: A Logic App can be used to automate the order fulfillment workflow for an e-commerce store. When a new order is placed, the Logic App can automatically create a new order in a shipping system, generate a shipping label, and send a notification to the customer with the tracking information.

DevOps automation: A Logic App can be used to automate various tasks in a DevOps workflow. For example, when a new code commit is made to a repository, the Logic App can automatically trigger a build process, run automated tests, deploy the code to a staging environment, and send notifications to the development team.

Overall, Azure Logic Apps can be used for a wide range of use cases that involve automating business workflows and integrating with various services and systems.
